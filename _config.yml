marketing_header: A theme-park based mobile visual scavenger hunt -- now with Universal Studios Florida! # Optional
marketing_desc: Park Pursuit is a visual scavenger hunt. The game is designed to allow scavenger hunts to be created anywhere in the world. However, living in Central Florida, the Disney Theme Parks seemed to be the natural place to start. As a bonus, we recently added 20 clues to seek from the Brigham Young University Campus in Provo, Utah. <p>To start a hunt, select an available park, and then you will be presented with a series of images. Each image is a clue to a landmark somewhere within that park.</p><p>If you need a hint, tap the "Hint" link (or the ? icon), and the app will tell you the rough compass direction you should seek, along with a snarky comment about your distance from it.</p><p>When you think you have found the landmark, tap the "Found It" link (or the eye icon). The app will compare your current location to the location embedded in the clue itself. You must be within 25 meters of the clue's location to consider it "found." Once found, that image will be marked as found and updated in the list of clues.</p><p>There is no limit to the number of clues or parks you can seek simultaneously. Your progress is saved automatically.</p><p>We intend to add more parks (and not just Disney Parks) to the mix, along with the ability for players to submit their own parks and clues. Watch for application updates.
