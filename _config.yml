marketing_header: A theme-park based mobile visual scavenger hunt -- now includes all six major Central Florida Theme Parks! # Optional
marketing_desc: <p>About four years ago, my manager arranged a team outing at Disney's Epcot theme park. The activity was to be a photo scavenger hunt. He divided us into teams and gave each team a set of photos he'd taken of tiny details he'd found throughout the park. Each team had four hours to find as many of these clues as possible, and then meet him at a specified place and time. Everyone involved loved the activity.</p><p>Inspired by this event, my wife and I ran a similar scavenger hunt for a youth group a few weeks later at Magic Kingdom. It was a big hit. The only complaint anyone had was the fact that everything was on paper. It rained during the day, and many of the teams' papers got wet. </p><p>Why not do it on the phone?</p><p>That's where Park Pursuit was born. Using a popular cross-platform mobile development framework, I created a basic scavenger hunt application that anyone can play on their phones. Each image in every supported park is geotagged with its location. To create a new game, the player selects a park and the number of clues to be sought. In-progress games are saved automatically, and it is possible to have multiple games going at the same time. The clue images appear on the screen together, so they may be searched for in any order desired. Some of them are harder than others, though the game currently has no way to score the difficulty of each image. </p><p>Tapping an image reveals a detail page, with a slightly more enlarged version.Tapping that image flips it over, revealing a hint about how far away and in what direction the actual location might be. There is also a button labeled "Found it." </p><p>When the player thinks they've found the right spot in the park, they click the Found It button. At that point, the geotagged location of the image is compared with the current location of the device. If the two are within a predetermined distance, the image is deemed to have been found. If not, the player is shown a mild, but snarky response telling them to get closer. </p><p>Park Pursuit is available now</p><p>Right now, the free version of Park Pursuit is available in both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. This version includes clues in two Orlando-area theme parks &mdash; Disney's Animal Kingdom Park, and Universal's Islands of Adventure. I also have clues ready for Disney's other three Florida theme parks and Universal Studios Orlando. As part of our development and testing, we also have a small number of clues in Celebration, Florida, and the BYU campus in Provo, Utah.</p>
